# no-gravity-here
This is a little rocket ship game written with the [Phaser framework](https://phaser.io)
and NodeJS. Don't crash into the sun!

## Controls
- The top arrow key accelerates the ship with the main engine.
- The bottom arrow key brakes the ship. Be careful: this will send you
  onto a crash trajectory into the gravity well.

Rotation:
- Left arrow / Right arrow: turn the ship.
- Space stop the rotation of the ship.
- Numpad numbers: point the ship into a certain direction.
